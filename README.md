# goose3-dashboard
Dashboard backend code for Goose 3 Waterloop Pod

Qt-client contains the test project for the client side code for QT to communicate with the relay_server using JSON over UDP
and to send commands to the relay_server over TCP.

Qt-client:
  main.cpp - runs the console application to read data from relay server

  myudp.h 
  myudp.cpp - Receives UDP data and prints it. In the completed version with all relevent sensors, the data gets processed here.
  
  mytcp.h
  mytcp.cpp - Establishes a tcp connection to the relay_server and sends commands to relay_server. 
              Should be usable in the generic sense, and send any commands that the user deems necessary.

  Might add a few more files to help with data processing and graphing. Smoothing out of sensor data is also required for Pod stability UI features.
